# Node js

Node is the backend runtime(to run server side code in javascript) for the javscript frontend developer to become a backend developer as well, ie. a fullstack developer

For a fullstack web developer, one must must know 
Frontend Javascript framework: React/Angular/Vue
Backend Runtime Env : Nodejs/Deno 

First file to run (main function): "index.js"
nvm is the node version manager, npm is the node package manager


Node is mostly an asynchronous-eventdriven which means, we listen for events and executes required actions or functions, and they can be performed async in seperate threads to maintain high efficiency and speed.
**Futures and Promises** allow for better managing multiple async functions and requests, by acting as a function block for multiple async functions. 


The power of community makes node much more powerful because there is a node module for everything you need. So the main logic for the task is wrapped around an easy to use function, similar to plugins in Flutter, these are installed using npm ("package.json")

For example:
Official Modules: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/
Third-party Powerful modules: https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs#readme

Most popular use:
**Express**: npm install express, a minimal web application framework, similar to flask which then allows me *route* pages and *parse* data.
This can also become a **REST api** which sends and receives JSON data over https using Insomnia/Postman to test 

Easily deploy this server in the cloud, using GCP App Engine, which is specially built for node and scales automatically. For this you must then connect and maintain the cloud server.
